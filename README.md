As mentioned above, the main part of the project(drawing the terrain) was taken from Daniel Shiffman's channel. You can find the video below.
Working with JavaFX to make a complete project like this has been very stressing, especially considering the amount of things -that are mostly provided in most other modern frameworks (the ones I saw at least)- you have to build from scratch with basic elements.
Also, JavaFX  looks are outdated and it was very hard to implement modern designs that may have taken just few lines in other frameworks.

### As mentioned, working with JavaFX has been hard, and I would like to thank some people whose works were very important in completing this project : 


**TimeLine and Post UIs** :

The main page UI is the largely the same as [Mahmoud Hamwi](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcAThteKmBlwCKsKlJhOQfA)'s [JavFX UI: Facebook Design with Dynamic VBbox items](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nqY-DKP9A) video.

**Chat Box UI** :

The messaging box UI has largely been taken from [![](https://img.shields.io/youtube/channel/subscribers/UCJnCCO9QVAP9saemgZ9tpoQ?label=WittCode&style=social)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJnCCO9QVAP9saemgZ9tpoQ)'s [JavaFX and Java Sockets - Client Server Messenger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nqY-DKP9A) video.

**CSS :**

[Nonameplum](https://github.com/nonameplum)'s [![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/nonameplum/md-button-fx-sample?label=md-button-fx-sample&style=social)](https://github.com/nonameplum/md-button-fx-sample) css was used to give the buttons a modern look.\
_<sub>There was also another source that I used to make the side scrollers look modern</sub>_

**Icons** : 

Most of the icons in the project were from [icons8.com windows app](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NK8T1KSHFFR). You should give it a try.
